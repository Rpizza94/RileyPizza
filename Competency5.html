of Core Competency:</span>
          </span>
          <br>While students have their own interpretations about how they performed in a course (typically by looking at their grades), instructors know that students have performed well if they have met course objectives. The question is, how do we know that they've met course objectives? While exams seem to be the primary mode of assessment, are there other ways? Moreover, are there ways we can use assessment to inform educators of the efficacy of their teaching methods?&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700;">The goal of this competency is to understand how to adequately assess student learning, and how to use those assessments to evaluate hypotheses about pedagogy.</span>

          <span class="u-text-palette-1-base" style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.25rem;">Artifacts and Rationale&nbsp;</span>
          <br>From my experience as an educator, I knew that there were clear differences in grade outcomes across our students--some did well, and some did poorly, despite using empirically-supported pedagogy. I wondered if there were methods I could use that would help my teaching meet the needs of all the students in my course. I began to research this question and discovered research around the importance of having a growth mindset (believing that intelligence is not a fixed trait). I wondered if implementing activities designed to increase a students growth mindset, alongside traditional active learning activities, could reduce achievement gaps across students. This inspired my "Teaching as Research" mentored project titled "Effects of Growth Mindset Interventions on Student Confidence and Academic Achievement":<br>

comprehension, especially in historically excluded groups, although this does
not always close the achievement gap. One potential explanation is that these
students are exhibiting a fixed mindset on intelligence, preventing them from
engaging meaningfully in challenging active learning activities. However, rarely have student mindsets and academic success been evaluated under
both active learning and growth mindset interventions.&nbsp;</p>

            <br>
          </span>From this project, I learned a lot of things. First, implementing growth mindset activities is an effective way to reduce achievement gaps between students. Second, by recording the outcomes of student assessment, I was able to empirically evaluate my teaching strategies. Often, the only feedback we get about teaching comes from student opinions--which are not always connected to how much they actually learn in class. It also gave me feedback from all students in my class (through exam scores) which meant I could see how my teaching strategies impacted all students. Finally, I learned the importance of backwards-designing assessments. I knew when I started I wanted to evaluate student achievement, but once I began to parse out my ideas I realized that what I REALLY wanted to know wasn't necessarily their overall understanding of concepts, but how well they were able to answer questions that corresponded to active learning activities we had done in class. This would allow me to directly test if growth mindset activities really did influence students' ability to focus intently on active learning activities in class.
